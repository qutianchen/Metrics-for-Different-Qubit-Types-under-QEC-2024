In each of these developments, Rolf Landauer has played a crucial role in nudging us, and other workers in the field, into asking the right questions, some of which we have been lucky enough to answer. A general overview of the key ideas of quantum error correction is given. We discuss how quantum entanglement is the key to protecting quantum states from decoherence in a manner which, in a theoretical sense, is as effective as the protection of digital data from bit noise. We also discuss five general criteria which must be satisfied to implement a quantum computer in the laboratory, and we illustrate the application of these criteria by discussing our ideas for creating a quantum computer out of the spin states of coupled quantum dots.}

	abstract = {We use the benefits and components of classical computers every day. However, there are many types of problems which, as they grow in size, their computational complexity grows larger than classical computers will ever be able to solve. Quantum computing (QC) is a computation model that uses quantum physical properties to solve such problems. QC is at the early stage of large-scale adoption in various industry domains to take advantage of the algorithmic speed-ups it has to offer. It can be applied in a variety of areas, such as computer science, mathematics, chemical and biochemical engineering, and the financial industry. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview to chemical and biochemical researchers and engineers who may not be familiar with quantum computation. Thus, the paper begins by explaining the fundamental concepts of QC. The second contribution this publication tries to tackle is the fact that the chemical engineering literature still lacks a comprehensive review of the recent advances of QC. Therefore, this article reviews and summarizes the state of the art to gain insight into how quantum computation can benefit and optimize chemical engineering issues. A bibliography analysis covers the comprehensive literature in QC and analyzes quantum computing research in chemical engineering on various publication topics, using Clarivate analytics covering the years 1990 to 2020. After the bibliographic analysis, relevant applications of QC in chemical and biochemical engineering are highlighted and a conclusion offers an outlook of future directions within the field.},

	abstract = {Universal quantum computing holds the promise to fundamentally change today’s information-based society, yet a hardware platform that will provide a clear path to fault-tolerant quantum computing remains elusive. One recently proposed platform involves the use of circuit-bound photons to build cluster states and perform one-way measurement-based quantum computations on arrays of long-coherence-time solid-state spin qubits. Herein, we discuss the challenges that are faced during any practical implementation of this architecture by itemizing the key physical building blocks and the constraints imposed on the spin qubits and the photonic circuit components by the requirements of fault-tolerant performance. These considerations point to silicon as a leading candidate to host such a platform, and a roadmap for developing a silicon photonic circuit-based platform for measurement-based, fault-tolerant universal quantum computing is offered.},
