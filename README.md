# Metrics-for-Different-Qubit-Types-under-QEC-2024

This is a report from course QIST4100 in Master programme Quantum Information Science and Technology from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). 

In this report, we examine metrics of popular qubit types (superconducting qubit, quantum dot, ion traps, neutral atoms, photonic qubit, bosonic qubit) that we consider essential in the Fault-Tolerent Quantum Computing(FTQC) era and discuss their own challenges to move towards the goal of FTQC.
