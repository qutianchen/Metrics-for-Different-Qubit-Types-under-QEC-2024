\section*{Summary}
This report examines and gives an overall review on six different types of qubits (superconductor, semiconductor spin, neutral atom, trapped-ion, bosonic, and photonic) that are widely discussed today. The report focuses on different metrics for these qubits in the form of a table and discuss their future potentials. This is done specifically under the lens of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) which this report considers to be the future direction of quantum computing. This report also provides the reader with reviews in a case-by-case manner for each qubit type.
